## Definition 
A linked list is a fundamental data structure used to store a collection of elements. Unlike arrays, where elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, linked lists store elements in nodes scattered throughout memory. Each node contains two parts:

Data: The actual value of the element.
Pointer (or Reference): A reference (or pointer) to the next node in the list.

## Types of Linked Lists
Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node in the sequence, and the last node points to NULL.
Doubly Linked List: Each node points to both the next and the previous node. This allows traversal in both directions.
Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the first node, forming a circle. It can be singly or doubly linked.
Eg-
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
};
Here, data stores the value of the element, and next is a pointer to the next node in the list.

### Basic Operations
1. Insertion: Adding elements to the list
At the beginning: Insert a node at the head of the list.
At the end: Traverse the list and insert a node at the tail.
At a specific position: Insert a node at a given position.
2. Deletion: Removing elements from the list
From the beginning: Remove the head node.
From the end: Traverse to the second-last node and set its next pointer to NULL.
From a specific position: Remove the node at a given index.
3. Traversal: Visit each node in the list to process or display its data.
4. Searching: Find an element in the list by comparing the value of each node’s data.
5. Reversing: Reverse the order of nodes in the list.

# Algorithms
## Algorithm for implementation of linked list
Step 1: Define a Class for the Node
Create a class Link to represent a node of the linked list.
Inside the class:
Declare an integer data to store the value of the node.
Declare a pointer next of type Link* to store the address of the next node.

Step 2: Define the Constructor
Create a constructor Link(int num) that takes an integer parameter:
Set data equal to num (the value passed during object creation).
Initialize next to NULL, meaning that the current node doesn’t point to any other node.

Step 3: Create a Node in Main Function
In the main function:
Declare a pointer l1 of type Link* and dynamically allocate memory for it using new.
Initialize the node with the value 6 by calling the constructor.

Step 4: Print Node Data and Pointer to Next Node
Use cout to print the value of the node (l1->data).
Print the address stored in next using l1->next, which should be NULL for this node.

Step 5: End the Program
Return 0 to indicate successful completion of the program.

## Algorithm for adding node at begenning
Step 1: Define the Node Class
Create a class named Node to represent each node in the linked list.
Inside the class:
Declare an integer value to store the value of the node.
Declare a pointer next of type Node* to point to the next node in the list.
Define a constructor Node(int data):
Set value to the parameter data.
Initialize next to NULL, indicating no next node.

Step 2: Define the Function to Insert at Head
Define a function insertAtHead(Node* &head, int value) to insert a new node at the beginning of the list:
Create a new Node object named new_node and initialize it with the value.
Set the next pointer of new_node to the current head.
Update head to point to new_node.

Step 3: Define the Function to Display the List
Define a function display(Node* head) to print the elements of the linked list:
Initialize a temporary pointer temp to head.
While temp is not NULL, do the following:
Print the value of the current node followed by " -> ".
Move temp to the next node (temp = temp->next).
After the loop, print "NULL" to indicate the end of the list.

Step 4: Implement the Main Function
In the main function:
Declare a pointer head of type Node* and initialize it to NULL to represent an empty list.
Call insertAtHead(head, 4) to insert the value 4 at the head and display the list.
Call insertAtHead(head, 5) to insert the value 5 at the head and display the list again.
Call insertAtHead(head, 10) to insert the value 10 at the head and display the list one final time.

Step 5: End the Program
Return 0 from the main function to indicate successful completion of the program.
